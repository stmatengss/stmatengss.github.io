# Brief Bio

I was born in Anhui, China. I received my Bachelor degree in computer science from University of Science and Technology Beijng, China in July 2016. Now I am a PhD candidate in Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, China.
<!-- I joined Alibaba as a research intern in September 2018. -->

My research advisors are [Prof. Yongwei Wu](http://madsys.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~yongweiwu/) and [Prof. Kang Chen](http://madsys.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~kangchen/). Currently, I work closely with [Dr. Mingxing Zhang](http://madsys.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~zhangmx/) and [Prof. Xuehai Qian](http://alchem.usc.edu/portal/xuehaiq.html).

My research interests include distributed database, Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA), Non-Volatile Memory(NVM), Out-of-core Graph Processing, and key-value store systems.
