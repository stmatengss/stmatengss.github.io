Even though I haven’t gained a very high award, but I learned how to program and get the experience improved my interesting to CS.\r\n\r\n### Which things that I have done in my college\r\n> I have attended several competitions which mainly depending on programming, which really showed my professional and advantages. I am a member of our school’s ACM Team, I have gained the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest Bronze medal and the Fifth National Professional Software Engineering \"Blue Bridge Cup\" Design contest C/C++ Second Prize. On the other hand, I have joined the object Self organization and location system based on TOA. With the professor’s guidance, I have finished all of the tasks perfectly. I have improved the details of the algorithm of the location and I designed a matlab program which can handle the dates. Between the four years university life, I can use C/C++/C#/java/python/scala/LinuxShell to solve some problems based on the actual scene. On the other hand, I have handled the basic knowledge about ML(Machine Learning)/AI(Artificial Intelligence)/DS(Distributed System)/PR(Pattern Recognition).\r\n\r\n* ACM award\r\n![Bronze medal](my_img/20150914190726_00003.jpg)\r\n* Blue Bridge Cup\r\n![C/C++ Second Prize](my_img/20150914190726_00002.jpg)\r\n* the chess AI contest of China\r\n![Second Class Prize]()\r\n* IOT(Internet of Things) contest\r\n![First Class Prize](my_img/img-602143024-0013.jpg)\r\n\r\n### My plan in future\r\n> I have interesting in almost everything. But I will be focused on DS(Distributed System) and HPC(Highly Performance Compute), especially for the DFS(Distributed File System), Cloud Compute, and GC(Graph Compute).\r\n\r\n### My Introduction\r\n> [My resume](https://github.com/stmatengss/stmatengss.github.io/简短简历（马腾）+.pdf) is here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
