Even though I haven’t gained a very high award, but I learned how to program and get the experience improved my interesting to CS.\r\n\r\n### Which things that I have done in my college\r\n> I have attended several competitions which mainly depending on programming, which really showed my professional and advantages. I am a member of our school’s ACM Team, I have gained the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest Bronze medal and the Fifth National Professional Software Engineering \"Blue Bridge Cup\" Design contest C/C++ Second Prize. On the other hand, I have joined the object Self organization and location system based on TOA. With the professor’s guidance, I have finished all of the tasks perfectly. I have improved the details of the algorithm of the location and I designed a matlab program which can handle the dates. Between the four years university life, I can use _C/C++/C#/java/python/scala/LinuxShell_ to solve some problems based on the actual scene. On the other hand, I have handled the basic knowledge about _ML(Machine Learning)/AI(Artificial Intelligence)/DS(Distributed System)/PR(Pattern Recognition)_.\r\n* [`2015 ACM-ICPC China Shanghai Metropolitan Programming Contest Bronze Model`](stmatengss.github.io/my_img/20150914190726_00003.jpg)\r\n* [`2015 ACM-ICPC Asia Shanghai Regional Contest Bronze Model`](stmatengss.github.io/my_img/20150914190726_00003.jpg)\r\n* [`Blue Bridge Cup C/C++ Second Prize`](stmatengss.github.io/my_img/20150914190726_00002.jpg)\r\n* [`the chess AI contest of China Second Class Prize`](stmatengss.github.io)\r\n* [`IOT(Internet of Things) contest First Class Prize`](stmatengss.github.io/my_img/img-602143024-0013.jpg)\r\n* [`2016 Mathematical Contest In Modeling Honorable Mention`](stmatengss.github.io/my_img/img-602143024-0013.jpg)\r\n\r\n### My plan in future\r\n> I have interesting in almost everything. But I will be focused on _DS(Distributed System)_ and _HPC(Highly Performance Compute)_, especially for the _DFS(Distributed File System)_, _Cloud Compute_, and _GC(Graph Compute)_.\r\n\r\n### My Introduction\r\n> [My resume](https://github.com/stmatengss/stmatengss.github.io/简短简历（马腾）+.pdf) is here.\r\n* `Phone: 86-156-5293-3334`\r\n* `E-mail: stmatengssAT163.com or stmatengssATgmail.com`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
