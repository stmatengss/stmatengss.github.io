<!-- # Brief Bio -->

<!-- I was born in Anhui, China. I received my Bachelor degree in computer science from University of Science and Technology Beijng, China in July 2016. Now I am a PhD candidate in Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, China. -->
I was born in Anhui, China. I received my Bachelor degree in computer science from University of Science and Technology Beijng, China in July 2016 and my PhD degree in computer science from Tsinghua University, China in June 2021. During my PhD, my research advisors are [Prof. Yongwei Wu](http://madsys.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~yongweiwu/) and [Prof. Kang Chen](http://madsys.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~kangchen/), and I work closely with [Dr. Mingxing Zhang](http://madsys.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~zhangmx/) and [Prof. Xuehai Qian](http://alchem.usc.edu/portal/xuehaiq.html). I have spent half a year as a visiting student at [Prof. Shan Lu's group](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~shanlu/) at the University of Chicago.
<!-- I have joined Alibaba as a research intern from Sep 2018 to Dec 2019. -->

<!-- My research advisors are [Prof. Yongwei Wu](http://madsys.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~yongweiwu/) and [Prof. Kang Chen](http://madsys.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~kangchen/). 

Currently, I work closely with [Dr. Mingxing Zhang](http://madsys.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~zhangmx/) and [Prof. Xuehai Qian](http://alchem.usc.edu/portal/xuehaiq.html).
 -->

After obtaining PhD degree, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Alibaba from 2021 to 2023, advised by Dr. Zhengyu He (CTO of Ant Group) and Prof. Zhaoxiang Zhang. Currently, I am a researcher (Staff Engineer) in Operating System Lab (OSLab) at Alibaba Cloud.


Now I build innovative software systems exploiting new hardware and kernel features in novel architectures such as memory disaggregation and LLM. 
My work has appeared at top systems venues such as SOSP (2), ASPLOS (2), USENIX ATC (3), SC, INFOCOM, VLDB, TPDS, ToN, etc.
