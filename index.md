### My programming life
> When I was a young man, I have always enjoyed working with computers. So I joined the NOIP team when I’m a senior high school student. Even though I haven’t gained a very high award, but I learned how to program and get the experience improved my interesting to CS.

### Which things that I have done in my college
> I have attended several competitions which mainly depending on programming, which really showed my professional and advantages. I am a member of our school’s ACM Team, I have gained the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest Bronze medal and the Fifth National Professional Software Engineering "Blue Bridge Cup" Design contest C/C++ Second Prize. On the other hand, I have joined the object Self organization and location system based on TOA. With the professor’s guidance, I have finished all of the tasks perfectly. I have improved the details of the algorithm of the location and I designed a matlab program which can handle the dates. Between the four years university life, I can use _C/C++/C#/java/python/scala/LinuxShell_ to solve some problems based on the actual scene. On the other hand, I have handled the basic knowledge about _ML(Machine Learning)/AI(Artificial Intelligence)/DS(Distributed System)/PR(Pattern Recognition)_.

### My plan in future
> I have interesting in almost everything. But I will be focused on _DS(Distributed System)_ and _HPC(Highly Performance Compute)_, especially for the _DFS(Distributed File System)_, _Cloud Compute_, and _GC(Graph Compute)_.
